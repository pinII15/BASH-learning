Write a Shell script that receives any number of file names as arguments checks if
every argument supplied is a file or a directory and reports accordingly. Whenever the
argument is a file, the number of lines on it is also reported.

#!/bin/bash
for i in ./* 
do
if [ -f $i ]
then
echo -n "$i is a file." 
echo "$(cat $i | wc -l) lines"
else
echo "$i is a directory"
fi
done
